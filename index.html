         When I was in highschool I developed a passion on computer subject.<br>I started playing games,
         looking into youtubes and eventually my heart choose to study software developents at moringa school.</br>
              When I graduated from highschool
          I meet a humble friend of mine named James Muriuki who told me hows life in moringa school.<br>
         He told me how he began to learn in the school so I got encouraged to pursue my dream just like him as a UX/UI designer
            and follow his footsteps.</br>
